Small compiler based on https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler3.html

Extended with:

- Logical operators (and, or, not)
- ELSE IF and ELSE
- FOR loop
- Better compiler errors (e.g., what line the error occurred)
- Functions with parameters and return values
- Abstract syntax tree representation
- More primitive types (e.g., integer, strings, boolean)
